    \item \textbf{Part b)}: The solution clearly evaluates the commutator \(\left[ \hat{X}, \hat{H}\right]\) and uses the result from part a) effectively to show the required relationship. However, it erroneously states the commutation relation for \(\hat{X}\) and \(\hat{P}^2\) as \(2i\hbar\hat{P}\) without showing the intermediate steps. \textbf{(3 marks)} The correct approach would involve a detailed derivation of the commutator \(\left[ \hat{X}, \hat{P}^2\right]\) to justify the result.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Feedback}: The solution is well-structured and follows the logical steps to derive the required equations. However, part b) would benefit from a more detailed explanation of the commutation relation involving \(\hat{P}^2\).

\textbf{Solution 2:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Part a)}: This solution follows the correct approach by differentiating the expectation value and substituting using the Schr\"odinger equation, but it does not explicitly show the algebraic simplification to the commutator form. \textbf{(4 marks)} It assumes the reader will implicitly understand this step, which could be confusing for those not familiar with the material.
    
    \item \textbf{Part b)}: The solution attempts to evaluate the commutator \(\left[ \hat{X}, \hat{H}\right]\), but it lacks clarity in the final steps to explicitly show how \(\left[ \hat{X}, \hat{H}\right] = \frac{i\hbar\hat{P}}{m}\). \textbf{(2 marks)} The explanation is somewhat vague and lacks the mathematical rigor needed to clearly justify the final relationship.
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Part b)}: The solution offers a thorough evaluation of the commutator \(\left[ \hat{X}, \hat{H}\right]\), including a detailed explanation of the commutation relations and their implications. However, it introduces an unnecessary complication in the explanation of the commutation relationship and how it leads to the final result, which might confuse the essence of the derivation. \textbf{(3 marks)} A more straightforward approach could have been taken to directly show the commutator’s impact on the expectation value.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Feedback}: The explanation is comprehensive, but part b) could be streamlined for clarity. Ensuring the derivations are both accurate and concisely presented would enhance understanding.

Summary

\begin{itemize}

\textbf{Part c)}  
- Variational principle and energy minimization: General discussion without correct, detailed mathematical treatment or explicit derivation for $b$: 0 marks.

\textbf{Total: 2/16}

\textbf{Feedback:}  
This solution starts with an incorrect approach to normalization and fails to calculate the expectation value of the Hamiltonian accurately. While it attempts to address the perturbation in terms of raising and lowering operators, the lack of precise mathematical derivation for the variational principle section and the incorrect formula for $\hat{x}$ limit its correctness and completeness. 

Solution 3:

\textbf{Part a)}  
- Correctly identifies the need for normalization but makes a conceptual error in solving for $b$: 1 mark.  
- Calculation of expectation value of Hamiltonian: Incorrect understanding of normalization leads to flawed expectation value: 0 marks.

\textbf{Part b)}

\textbf{Total: 2/16}

\textbf{Feedback:}  
The approach to solving the problem demonstrates an understanding of the quantum harmonic oscillator's basic principles but lacks accuracy and completeness in the application. Incorrect normalization and expectation value calculation, combined with an incomplete attempt at expressing the perturbation in terms of raising and lowering operators, significantly detract from the overall correctness. Additionally, the solution does not successfully apply the variational principle to derive the correct value of $b$ that minimizes energy, missing critical steps and calculations.

Each solution has its strengths and weaknesses, but all lack the detailed and accurate mathematical treatment required to solve the given problem fully. It's crucial for future attempts to adhere more closely to the principles of quantum mechanics, correctly apply mathematical methods, and ensure rigorous derivation processes to improve accuracy and completeness."
