\textbf{b) 5 marks out of 5:} Similarly, for \( \hat{Q} = \frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} \), the student effectively uses integration by parts twice and shows that the operator is Hermitian by correctly matching both sides of the equation. The explanation is thorough and follows the logic of the definition provided.

\textbf{Feedback:} Excellent work. The explanations are clear, and the mathematical techniques are correctly applied. The student demonstrates a strong understanding of Hermitian operators and their implications.

Solution 2

\textbf{a) 3 marks out of 4:} The student correctly identifies \( \hat{p} \) as a Hermitian operator and provides a general outline of the process, including integration by parts. However, the explanation lacks the detailed step-by-step mathematical justification found in Solution 1, which could potentially confuse readers unfamiliar with the process.

\textbf{b) 4 marks out of 5:} For \( \hat{Q} = \frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} \), the student again correctly concludes that the operator is Hermitian. The argument assumes the correct application of integration by parts twice and the vanishing of boundary terms without explicitly showing these steps, which slightly reduces the clarity and thoroughness of the explanation.

\textbf{Feedback:} Good effort, but the solution could benefit from more detailed mathematical demonstrations, especially regarding the integration by parts process. Providing explicit calculations would enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the explanations.

Solution 3

\textbf{a) 3 marks out of 4:} This solution correctly concludes that \( \hat{p} \) is a Hermitian operator, using a correct approach with integration by parts. However, the explanation is somewhat less rigorous in its mathematical presentation than Solution 1. There's a minor oversight in the detailed explanation of the integration by parts (specifically, not explicitly showing the calculation of the boundary terms and their cancellation).

\textbf{b) 4 marks out of 5:} The student correctly concludes that \( \hat{Q} \) is Hermitian, with a rationale similar to part a). The explanation, while correct, skips over detailed intermediate steps that would make the solution more accessible to readers unfamiliar with the process, such as explicitly showing the integration by parts steps and the cancellation of the boundary terms.

\textbf{Feedback:} The solution demonstrates a correct understanding of Hermitian operators but could be improved by providing more detailed mathematical steps and justifications. Explicitly showing all steps, especially for integration by parts and the handling of boundary terms, would strengthen the argument and make it more comprehensible."

Excellent work. The student demonstrates a thorough understanding of Hermitian operators and applies the definition correctly to both parts of the problem. The explanations are clear, and the mathematical steps are correctly and logically presented.

Solution 2 Grading

\textbf{Part a) Grade: 3/4}

The explanation starts well by substituting \( \hat{p} \) into the given definition. However, the solution is somewhat vague about the details of the integration by parts process, especially in matching the LHS and RHS explicitly. It correctly concludes that \( \hat{p} \) is Hermitian but lacks clarity in the mathematical justification.

\textbf{Part b) Grade: 4/5}

The student correctly identifies \( \hat{Q} \) as Hermitian but, similar to part a), the explanation of the integration by parts process is less detailed and somewhat assumes the outcome without showing all intermediate steps. The conclusion is correct but could benefit from a clearer exposition of the process.

\textbf{Feedback:}

Good effort. The student has a correct understanding of the problem and arrives at the right conclusions. However, the solutions would benefit from more detailed explanations of the mathematical steps, especially in the integration by parts process, to fully justify the conclusions.

Solution 3 Grading

This solution provides a comprehensive step-by-step explanation of how \( \hat{p} \) satisfies the definition of a Hermitian operator. The student correctly uses integration by parts and clearly shows that the LHS equals the RHS, justifying that \( \hat{p} \) is Hermitian.

\textbf{Part b) Grade: 4/5}

The solution to part b) is mostly correct, with a clear explanation and correct conclusion that \( \hat{Q} \) is Hermitian. However, it slightly glosses over the detailed verification of the second integration by parts, assuming the outcome rather than explicitly showing it. This minor oversight slightly reduces the clarity of the proof.

\textbf{Feedback:}

Very good work. The student shows a strong understanding of Hermitian operators and applies the concepts correctly to both parts of the problem. The explanations are clear, and the mathematical reasoning is solid. A bit more detail in the second part of the b) solution would make the argument even stronger."

\subsection*{Question 10:}

\textbf{Response 1:}

"Solution 1 Grading

\textbf{Part a):} The student correctly applies the normalization condition and calculates the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. The normalization part is well-explained, showing that \(1 + |b|^2 = 1\) leads to a misunderstanding; however, their process in calculation seems logically consistent until they mistakenly concluded that \(1 + |b|^2 = 1\) directly, without addressing the need for the square root in the denominator of the state for normalization. The expectation value calculation is correct in form but doesn't consider the normalization of \(|\psi\rangle\) correctly because \(|b|^2\) was not derived from the normalization condition correctly.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Marks for part a}: 3/5
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Part b):} The student correctly rewrites the perturbation in terms of raising and lowering operators. This part is done correctly and succinctly.

    \item \textbf{Marks for part b}: 2/2
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Part c):} The explanation for applying the variational principle is generic and does not include specific calculations or a clear derivation of the given formula for \(b\). The explanation is qualitative rather than quantitative. Although they mention the importance of differentiating the total energy with respect to \(b\) and solving for \(b\), they do not provide the steps for this derivation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Marks for part c}: 5/9
\end{itemize}

\textbf{General Feedback}: The solution provides a good overview of the problem but lacks precise mathematical details in part c. The normalization in part a is conceptually correct but could be more accurately reflected in the calculation. More rigorous mathematical derivation in part c would improve the completeness of the solution.

Solution 2 Grading

\textbf{Part a):} The normalization is addressed correctly, but the final conclusion that \(|b|^2 = 1\) is incorrect, showing a misunderstanding of the normalization process. The expectation value calculation is partially correct but assumes \(|b|^2 = 1\) without justification and misses the correct normalization factor.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Marks for part a}: 2/5
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Part b):} This part is done correctly, with the perturbation correctly rewritten in terms of raising and lowering operators.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Marks for part b}: 2/2
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Part c):} The student provides a brief overview of the variational principle and mentions the need to derive \(b\) for minimizing energy but does not provide a concrete derivation or clear steps to reach the given formula for \(b\). The explanation is more of a conceptual overview rather than a detailed mathematical approach.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Marks for part c}: 4/9
\end{itemize}

\textbf{General Feedback}: The solution shows an understanding of the concepts but lacks mathematical rigor, particularly in the normalization process and the derivation of \(b\) in part c. Providing correct calculations and a detailed derivation for \(b\) would significantly improve the solution.

Solution 3 Grading

\textbf{Part a):} The normalization attempt shows confusion, particularly with the conclusion that \(1 + |b|^2 = 1\) leading to an incorrect interpretation. The expectation value of the Hamiltonian is discussed, but the error in normalization affects the accuracy of this part.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Marks for part a}: 2/5
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Part b):} The student aims to rewrite the perturbation in terms of raising and lowering operators but does not provide the final expression clearly in this summary. It seems there was an intention to solve it correctly, but without showing the explicit final form, it's hard to award full marks.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Marks for part b}: 1/2
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Part c):} While the student acknowledges the complexity of applying the variational principle and the need for a detailed calculation, they do not provide specific steps or a clear derivation for the formula of \(b\). The explanation indicates an understanding of the process but lacks the mathematical demonstration needed for full marks.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Marks for part c}: 4/9
\end{itemize}

\textbf{General Feedback}: The solution demonstrates an attempt to understand and explain the problem parts but suffers from inaccuracies and lacks detailed mathematical derivations, particularly in normalization and deriving the specific formula for
\(b\) in part c. A more rigorous approach to the calculations and clearer mathematical demonstrations would be necessary for a higher score."

\begin{itemize}
    \item Accurately rewriting the perturbation in terms of raising and lowering operators (2/2 marks).

    \item Although the solution indicates an understanding of the variational principle and its application, it fails to provide the mathematical details necessary to derive the formula for \( b \), making the explanation incomplete.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{General Feedback:}
This solution shows an understanding of the basic principles involved in the problem but falls short in mathematical rigor and completeness, especially in part c). The mistake in the normalization part impacts the subsequent calculation of the expectation value. A more accurate and detailed approach, particularly in applying the variational principle to derive \( b \), would significantly improve the solution.

Solution 3 Grading:

\textbf{Part a) Normalization and Expectation Value of the Hamiltonian:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Incorrect conclusion in the normalization step, leading to confusion in the expectation value calculation (2/5 marks).
    \item The solution incorrectly manipulates the normalization condition, leading to a fundamental misunderstanding of the normalization process, which affects the validity of the subsequent expectation value calculation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Part b) Perturbation in Terms of Raising and Lowering Operators:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Correctly identifying the need to rewrite the perturbation but lacks clarity in the execution (1/2 marks).
    \item The solution starts on the right path but does not clearly or correctly articulate the transformation of the perturbation into the terms of raising and lowering operators.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Part c) Variational Principle and Finding \( b \):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The solution is vague and lacks any concrete mathematical derivation or clear explanation of how to apply the variational principle to find \( b \) (3/9 marks).
    \item The attempt to explain the application of the variational principle is recognized, but the absence of detailed mathematical steps and a clear pathway to derive the given formula for \( b \) makes this part incomplete and not very informative.

\textbf{General Feedback:}
The approach demonstrates an attempt to understand and explain the concepts involved in the problem, but significant inaccuracies and a lack of mathematical detail greatly diminish the solution's effectiveness. Particularly, the misunderstanding in the normalization process and the lack of concrete steps in applying the variational principle and deriving \( b \) are major shortcomings. A more accurate and mathematically rigorous approach, especially in normalization and the application of the variational principle, is needed for a comprehensive and correct solution."

The explanation hints at the correct approach but lacks the mathematical derivation needed to fully substantiate the given formula for \(b\).
    \item \textbf{General Feedback:} You have demonstrated a solid understanding of quantum mechanics concepts, especially in normalizing quantum states and manipulating operators. However, a more detailed approach to solving for \(b\) in part c would enhance the solution. Ensure that mathematical derivations are clearly connected to the physical concepts they represent.
\end{itemize}

Solution 2:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Part a):} 3 marks. The normalization attempt is incorrect as it concludes \(|b|^2 = 1\) erroneously from the normalization condition. The calculation of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is also based on this incorrect normalization, leading to an inaccurate result.
    \item \textbf{Part b):} 2 marks. Correctly rewrites the perturbation in terms of the raising and lowering operators, similar to solution 1.
    \item \textbf{Part c):} 4 marks. The explanation for applying the variational principle and finding the value of \(b\) that minimizes energy is too vague and lacks the necessary mathematical details to be convincing. The solution suggests an understanding of the variational principle but does not provide a complete derivation leading to the formula for \(b\).
    \item \textbf{General Feedback:} Your approach to normalization needs revision; it's crucial to correctly apply the normalization condition. Moreover, the solutions would benefit from more detailed mathematical derivations, especially in part c, where the variational principle's application was not thoroughly explained.
\end{itemize}

Solution 3:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Part a):} 2 marks. The solution contains significant misconceptions about normalization, incorrectly solving the normalization condition and misinterpreting the role of \(b\) in the process. This misunderstanding affects the calculation of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian.
    \item \textbf{Part b):} 1 mark. This part of the solution is missing, resulting in no marks awarded for rewriting the perturbation in terms of raising and lowering operators.
    \item \textbf{Part c):} 3 marks. The solution attempts to outline the process of applying the variational principle but lacks concrete steps and mathematical derivations. The explanation is too general and does not convincingly lead to the formula for \(b\).
    \item \textbf{General Feedback:} There's a clear need to review the basics of quantum state normalization and operator algebra. Understanding these foundational concepts is crucial for accurately solving quantum mechanics problems. Additionally, more detailed mathematical work is required to substantiate claims, especially in applying the variational principle in part c.
