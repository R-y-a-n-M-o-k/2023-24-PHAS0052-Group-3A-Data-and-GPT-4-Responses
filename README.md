# 2023/24 PHAS0052 Group-3A Project Data and GPT-4 Responses

This repository is built for 2023/24 Group 3A in the UCL PHAS0052 Physics Group Project. The project is on quantiative assessment of AI grading and performance in Physics education. We have constructed a method to evaluate how well a LLM model is at grading physics solutions. We test this methodology on OpenAI's GPT-4 LLM (between 15/02/2024 and 10/03/2024). In the repository you will find:

1. The question dataset used to test GPT-4 physics performance, grading ability and generate synthetic solutions. The pdf file is for ease of reading and the LaTeX coded file used for prompt construction is also included.

2. The Mark Scheme corresponding to the question dataset. This also includes a pdf file for reading with use for human grading and LaTeX document for prompt construction.

3. GPT-4 Solutions. These are the solutions which are generated by GPT-4. There are 90 solutions total, 3 for each question, 10 each per topic (EM,QM,CM). This includes the pdf file for reading and the LaTeX code file which is used for prompt input. 

4. GPT-4 Grading. This is the responses and feedback produced when GPT-4 grades the generated solutions. This includes grading where GPT-4 is not given the markscheme only the marks allocated to each question and grading where the markscheme is given to GPT-4 in the prompt.

5. Question Figures. Included are also the original figures created in use for the question dataset. These can be input into GPT-4 prompts and are used to generate the question dataset pdf file.

6. Grading done by humans for each GPT-4 solution.
