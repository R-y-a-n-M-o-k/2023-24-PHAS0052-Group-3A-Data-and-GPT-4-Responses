with \( E_{0} \), a real value denoting the amplitude, \( k \) is the wavevector, and \( \omega \) the angular frequency. \( (kx - \omega t) \) defines the phase of the wave in frame \( S \). Show that this phase in reference frame \( S' \) is written \( (k'x' - \omega' t') \), where primed coordinates correspond to the frame \( S' \) and

\[ \omega' = \gamma(\omega - kv), \quad k' = \gamma(k - \frac{\omega v}{c^{2}}) \]

\underline{v} = \underline{A} e^{-bt/m} - \frac{mg}{b} \hat{\underline{k}} 
\]

\noindent where \( \underline{A} \) is a constant vector.

\medskip

\noindent b) Given that the ball initially starts with velocity \( \underline{u} \), find an expression for \( \underline{A} \).
